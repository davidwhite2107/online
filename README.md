# Online learning algorithms for portfolio selection
## Description

This repository contains MATLAB code which implements the Universal Portfolios algorithm by Cover, 
the ANTICOR algorithm by Borodin et al. and the nearest neighbour algorithm by Gy√∂rfi et al. 
The data on which the algorithms are implemented is from the NYSE and can be found at http://www.cs.bme.hu/~oti/portfolio/data.html. 
The original data is included in the data folder as well as the files nyse.mat and nysemerged.mat which have the data in a usable format.
The code also includes measures of backtest overfitting introduced by Bailey et al.

## Dependencies
The files nyse_all_algorithms.m, nyse_all_algorithms_02.m, nysemerged_all_algorithms_01.m, nysemerged_all_algorithms_02.m
in the scripts folder
all depend on results from other script files in the scripts folder, which must be run first.
